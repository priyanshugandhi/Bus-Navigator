# Bus-Navigator

The main goal of the proposed web application is to improve the Bus system by adding the
necessary features, like accurate bus timings, correct bus numbers and moreover adding a GPS
tracker into it. This enables students to find out the location of the bus so that they won’t get late
or won’t arrive at the stop too early. The main purpose of this application is to provide exact
location of the student’s respective buses in Google Maps. This accepts input in the form of
selection of the source and destination and selection of the bus travelling the distance to display
the entire details about the routes and also track the location of the respective bus and give the
map for the same. It is a real time system as the current location of the bus is updated every
moment in the form of latitude and longitude which is received by the students through the
application on Google maps.

There are buses made available for students and teachers travelling distances, but not many
people have complete information about these buses. Complete information namely the bus
numbers, bus timings, the routes through which the bus would pass, time taken for the bus to
reach, maps that would guide the passenger with his/her route and most importantly, track the
current location of the bus and give the correct time for the bus to reach its bus stop. The
proposed system deals with overcoming the problems stated above. The system is a Web
application that gives necessary information about all the buses of Medicaps. This information
overcomes the problems faced by people in searching there buses. Brought up by Google, the
application uses Google app engine and Java programming language and its frameworks.
